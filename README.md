# Degree of profanity in sentence of tweet.
**Assumptions:**
- Here I have taken two sample arrays, one for tweets and other for storing racial slurs.
- Racial slurs used are: foo, bar and foobar.
- Formula used for finding degree of profanity of a sentence is number of racial slurs in a sentence divided by total number of words in a sentence.
- This degree of profanity value can be further used to take action over certain tweet.
